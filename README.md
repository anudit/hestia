# Hestia - Monorepo

Harberger Taxes is an economic abstraction that aims to democratize the control of assets and prices. In this taxation system, asset owners self-assess the value of assets they own and pay a tax rate of X% on that value. Whatever value owners specify for the asset, they have to be willing to part ways and sell it to anyone at that price.

Harberger Taxes on Hestia works as follows:

- NFT owners determine the value of their asset, and pay taxes on that price.
- Anyone at any time can acquire the NFT at the owner‚Äôs price, immediately taking ownership of the NFT upon purchase. The new owner can then set a new price.

NFT owners are incentivized to set a low price to minimize the amount taxes they have to pay. At the same time, owners are incentivized to set a price high enough to discourage others from buying it away too easily. This creates a balancing act for owners to price an NFT at the value they are willing to pay to keep it.

Because of these opposing pressures, NFT owners can‚Äôt set impossibly high prices nor refuse reasonably priced offers. This creates a more efficient and equitable market. Additionaly, it provides Creators on Hestia with a continous revenue stream with the taxes payed by the owners.
